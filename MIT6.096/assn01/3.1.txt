1. Didn't compile. Conflicting declaration error shown.

2. Program compiles. It prints A in standard output.

3. Inner block declaration is used.

4. Outer block declaration is used.

5. Header file is not in the right place. So cout is not defined in main. Moving header file to the top will solve the error.
